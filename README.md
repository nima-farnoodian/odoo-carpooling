# Odoo Carpooling

Carpooling is nowadays a way people use to share their transportation costs or to reduce fuel consumption and traffic. In order to provide a concert and safe solution for carpooling, an Odoo app has been proposed in this repo, which can be used and installed on the Odoo platform. 

## Problem domain

In this project for 'Open Source Project' course taught by [Prof. Yves Deville](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbGV6OAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Olivier Bonaventure](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=82Qy2m4AAAAJ&hl=en)
at [UClouvain](https://uclouvain.be), the students were asked to contribute to the open source projects. Thus, this repository includes the source code related to the Odoo Carpooling app designed by [Nima Farnoodian](mailto:nima.farnoodian@student.uclouvain.be). The app has been designed so that it can satisfy Odoo user's needs such as:

- Adding extra driver information such as driver's vehicle, vehicle image, etc. in the user settings.

- Sharing (Round) Trips through a booking system (users can book a trip offer, and the drive is able to either refuse or accept the offers).

- Complex search and filtering.

- Commenting on trips by trip passengers.

- etc. 

### Real Estate App

It is worth saying that this repository contains the real estate app, which is a part of [Odoo Developer Training](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/developer.html). Therefore, it could also stand as a helpful source for those people wishing to complete the training. The estate directory holds the solutions up to 13th chapter of the training.
